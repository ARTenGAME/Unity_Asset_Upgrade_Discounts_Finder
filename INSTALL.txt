Install the latest Python version, i use 3.13.9.
The system has been tested only in Windows.
Copy the "artngame_unity_upgrades_scraper.py" file in an
empty folder and open the command prompt in that
folder.

Install the below for Python

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install
python -m pip install requests

Add a publishers.txt file to define more than one publisher
Use name, publisher page URL format per line.
e.g. 1st line
ARTnGAME, https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/6503?pageSize=96

Run the file in the command prompt like below, while in the folder that
includes the file.
C:\Users\nasos\Documents\UnityPython> python artngame_unity_upgrades_scraper.py

The system will start in non headless mode to login to Unity account 
and then create the "storage_state.json" to keep the login alive
in next sessions. The next sessions will default to background
headless mode with a debug shown in command console.

After log in hit Enter in the command to proceed with the first run of
the system, the run will continue in background headless mode.

Optionally can use the "--no-headless" argument in python command 
to see the pages load.

The results are saved in unity_upgrade_discounts.csv and when
opened will also have clickable links to the assets and the
original and discounted price and the Publisher of the asset.

The "processed_assets.txt" saves the processed files thus far, in
case the script is interrupted. If need to renew all assets status
should erase the file to check all assets again.

The discounts include upgrade discounts and also any current
Unity sale discounts.

NOTES:
Do not open the files the system saved to, since can crash the program.
Can copy the CSV file and open the copy to preview the current progress.

If some entries return empty, may consider lowering the concurrent items
per batch and increase the wait time in the below code lines
BATCH_SIZE = 10
DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES = 10  # seconds
